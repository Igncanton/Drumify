# Drumify
This project is based on the Wes Bos 30 days of Javascript but I did it withouth looking at the tutorial, it's my first all by myself JavaScript project, I figured it out on my own, in this project I had to deal with event listeners, different scenarios for each input and trigger event, resolving in the use of many switch statements as well as the positioning and animation of each part of the drumset, all based on svgs parts that I had to perectly center to give the illusion of a real drumset, it was a super fun project which i'm gonna keep on extending as I keep on gaining more knowledge.</br>
</br>
ps: also it's super fun to play.</br>
